# MealMD

A little terminal bot I built that walks you through a few quick questions and then spits out meal ideas that actually fit your goals, tastes, and diet rules.

## Features
- Step-by-step interactive wizard â€” answer simple numbered questions
- Filters meals based on your preferences and avoidances
- Scores and recommends the top matches
- Shows ingredients, macros, and notes for each meal
- Runs entirely in your terminal (no internet connection required)

## Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imightbeparker/MealMD.git
cd MealMD
```
## Usage
Run the wizard:
```bash
python mealmd_wizard.py
```
Follow the prompts, and MealMD will recommend the best meal options for you.
